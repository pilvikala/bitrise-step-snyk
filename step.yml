  Bitrise Snyk Step incorporates Snyk into your Bitrise workflows.
  By utilizing this step, you will be able to test your project dependencies for vulnerabilities during builds and use Snyk to monitor your projects
  for new vulnerabilities.
  This step uses Snyk as an external service and requires your authentication token.

      description: |
        Specifies whether to fail the build or not based on the results found by Snyk.

        Snyk by default returns an error code from the test command. This may break your Bitrise workflow. By specifying `no`, the build can continue even if vulnerabilities are found.

        If enabled, imports the snapshot of dependencies to Snyk for continuous monitoring after a successful test.

        Set this value to `yes` to import the snapshot of dependencies to Snyk after a successful test. Snyk will then start monitoring the dependencies for new vulnerabilities and alert when a new vulnerability is discovered.
